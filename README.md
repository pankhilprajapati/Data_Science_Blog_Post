## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose Seattle Airbnb Open data. 

I will focus on the three question below:

Three main Topic

 - Understating the property feature
 - Understanding the price feature with month and property
 - Under standing the customer review

#### Questions

Q1. Checking the most common amenity avialable in the property

Q2. How many unverified host has verfied exact location and unverified exact location. And Vise Versa?

Q3. How increase rental of the property what words to use to name it and what words to using in descriptions?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.



Three data files 
calendar.csv - contain the date, and price of the property

listing.csv - contain the details of the host and 
the details of the property with the requirements 

reviews.csv - contain the customer review

There is also a notebook available here to showcsae all my work related to my three questions.
